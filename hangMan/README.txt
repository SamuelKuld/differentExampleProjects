This was a project that I worked on for a while. It is probably the most... Sealed project I have made with C++. 

How to use it, 

1 ) Each time there is a ">>> ", it means that you need to input something. Whether it be a blank input, number input, string input, anything. 

2 ) It will then ask you for your first guess. It is a mystery of how many letters there are until you guess at least once. 

3 ) It will then show all the letters that you have missed or won.

Known : // These are the ones that you do know are in the word

Missed : // These are the ones that you know are not in the word.

4 ) Past that, it's simple hangman. You get to choose the amount of turns you get too. You can have as many as you want because you're important.

This was mostly a test to see how well I was doing in C++. It was a good assurance I was at least doing alright.
